     <span class="start_text">Healer</span> is an unlicensed person who practices the art of healing using traditional practices, herbal remedies and the power of suggestion. The healer may be a highly trained person who pursues their specialties, learning by study, observation and imitation.
     Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
     This misconception is one of the most harmful because it implies that the symptoms surrounding mental illnesses are not valid, which makes those who are living with one feel like they don't matter.
     Emotional and mental health is important because it's a vital part of your life and impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or caregiving.
     Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, act, make choices, and relate to others. Mental health is more than the absence of a mental illness—it’s essential to your overall health and quality of life. Self-care can play a role in maintaining your mental health and help support your treatment and recovery if you have a mental illness.
     Self-care means taking the time to do things that help you live well and improve both your physical health and mental health. When it comes to your mental health, self-care can help you manage stress, lower your risk of illness, and increase your energy. Even small acts of self-care in your daily life can have a big impact.
     Seek professional help if you are experiencing severe or distressing symptoms that have lasted two weeks or more, such as:

Difficulty sleeping
Appetite changes that result in unwanted weight changes
Struggling to get out of bed in the morning because of mood
Difficulty concentrating
Loss of interest in things you usually find enjoyable
Inability to perform usual daily functions and responsibilities
Look around (like, literally look around or scan your timeline or Twitter feed). You may have noticed that we're making huge strides in destigmatizing mental illness, and that's fantastic. The importance of treating your mental health as you would your physical health is a pretty well accepted principle. It's becoming less taboo to talk openly about therapy and mental illness—there are almost as many celebrities talking about mental health as there are Keep Calm and Whatever decorations in literally any store you walk into. All signs point to the fact that we're prioritizing self care, and that's awesome.

But when it comes to actually being mentally well, we're a little murky on the follow-through. There's no shortage of self-care strategies out there, but not everyone has the time and money to spend on a wellness retreat or horse therapy or crystals that may or may not chill you out.
